0. Create requirements.txt, .env, setup.py, .gitignore files and copy paste from 
    https://github.com/yadav-avnish/aps-fault-detection 
1. Connect to mongo DB using the format
    "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0-saugt.mongodb.net/
2. Create data_dump.py file to save the downloaded data into mongoDB because in industry 
    the files in mongoDB will keep getting updated and we need to use the updated files from mongoDB
3. Create logger.py file for logging
    from logger import logging and type logging.info(f"starting ... from {directory}/{file} to ...")
4. Create exception.py file for exception handling
    from exception import ecommerce_exception and try: and except Exception as e:    raise ecommerce_exception(e, sys)
5. Now you need to get data from mongoDB to df to work on it, hence make a function in utils.py
